# In this project, I create a table with downloaded Spotify data on the top 50 songs of 2021 from Kaggle. 
# Then, I perform a series of queries on this data.


# Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

# First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

# Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

# Next, I display which artists had more than one song in the top 50 and how many songs of theirs were included
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

# What is the average energy of the top 5 most popular songs? 
SELECT avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 93;

# What is the average energy of the least 5 most popular songs? 
SELECT avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity < 79;
